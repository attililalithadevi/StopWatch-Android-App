# Stopwatch - Android App 
This application basically consists of 3 different textunits representing Hours, Minutes and Seconds.
Also we got two buttons on the UI. The first button will be changed on the basis of service state and the second button will allow us to cancel the foreground service which will result in resetting of our stopwatch.

You can control the stopwatch either by the UI buttons or with the notification panel. As we are using services, so if we even close the application then also we can track the stopwatch state by notification panel. 

Devices that run Android 12 (API level 31) or higher provide a streamlined experience for short-running foreground services. On these devices, the system waits 10 seconds before showing the notification associated with a foreground service. There are a few exceptions; several types of services always display a notification immediately.
